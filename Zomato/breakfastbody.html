Breakfast is the first meal of the day, typically eaten in the morning after waking up from sleep. It is often considered the most important meal of the day, as it provides the body with essential nutrients and energy needed to start the day.
A healthy breakfast should consist of a balanced mix of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats. Good breakfast options include whole-grain cereal with milk, eggs, whole-grain toast with avocado, yogurt with fruit and nuts, or a smoothie made with fruits, vegetables, and protein powder.
